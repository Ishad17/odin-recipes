        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish featuring layers of wide pasta sheets, ricotta or
        <br>béchamel sauce, hearty meat sauce, and melted mozzarella. The pasta sheets are alternated

        <br>perfection, lasagna delivers a harmonious blend of textures and flavors, making it a 
        <br>timeless and beloved homemade comfort food.</p>
